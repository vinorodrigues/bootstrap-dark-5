# The Ancillary Guide to Dark Mode and Bootstrap 5
**A continuation of the v4 Dark Mode POC, but this time for v5**

> This is a follow up to [The Definitive Guide to Dark Mode and Bootstrap 4](http://vinorodrigues.github.io/bootstrap-dark) body of work,
> and pertains to [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) *([Github repo.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap))*.

## About

This code will make little sense if you don't read
[The Definitive Guide to Dark Mode and Bootstrap 4](http://vinorodrigues.github.io/bootstrap-dark) first.


## What do you get?

The code compiles the four methods *(and variants - **six in total**)* of the original body of work, but compiled for and sourcing **Bootstrap 5**.  These are:

### Method 1

<small>*([link to original](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark/blob/master/README.md#method-1))*</small>

  *  **`bootstrap-night`**: This is simply a dark bootstrap theme.  It can however be used with the Bootstrap core CSS to deliver a 2-file dark mode functionality.

### Method 2

<small>*([link to original](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark/blob/master/README.md#method-2))*</small>

  * **`bootstrap-nightfall`**: This is simply the "color only" CSS of all the  components of Bootstrap core, but dark, and is intended to be used as an add-on.  It can also, with a simple media query, drive automatic dark mode switching.

### Method 3

<small>*([link to original](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark/blob/master/README.md#method-3))*</small>

  * **`bootstrap-nightshade`**: This is a modification of the Bootstrap core and adds dark color CSS for all the components, but dark, nested in a `html.dark` class wrapper.  By itself it cannot offer dark mode switching, but add the included `darkmode.js` library and you have an interactive dark mode switching variant of Bootstrap with built in ***"toggle"*** button support.

  * **`bootstrap-blackbox`**: ![New](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red) This variant is essentially the same as the "nightshade" variant, but instead of using a HTML tag class, it uses a HTML tag data attribute; `data-bs-color-scheme`.  The same `darkmode.js` library drives this one, all you need to do is add the data attribute to your HTML tag.

### Method 4

<small>*([link to original](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark/blob/master/README.md#method-4))*</small>

  * **`bootstrap-dark`**: This is the recommended method; one CSS with both light and dark themes, toggle-able only with the OS or browser `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

  * **`bootstrap-unlit`**: This variant is essentially the same as the "dark" variant, but with "dark" scheme as the primary/fallback and "light" as optioned in color scheme.

Yes.

> Licence is MIT.  *i.e. use as you whish as long as you credit the original authors and leave the copyright in situ.*

If you're a theme builder or want to use its principles in your own project you'll need to have
[Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1. Fork or download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark-5.git`
2. Install Node dependencies: `npm install`  *(See note below.)*
3. Modify `_variables.scss` and `_variables-alt.scss` in the `scss` sub-folder.
4. Run `npm run build` to build your theme.
5. The compiled code will be in the `dist` folder.

> ![NOTE:](https://img.shields.io/badge/NOTE%3A-069) The build system is based on [NPM Scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts). Most of the build tools _(NPM modules)_ will need to be installed as *"global"* to ensure the scripts are executable from the command line.

```bash
npm i -g  autoprefixer  documentation browser-sync  clean-css-cli  cross-env  eslint  eslint-config-xo  eslint-plugin-import  eslint-plugin-unicorn  find-unused-sass-variables  imagemin-cli  nodemon  npm-run-all  postcss-cli  rtlcss  sass  stylelint  stylelint-config-twbs-bootstrap  svgo  terser typescript
```

#### Note 1:

This code is just a rehash of Bootstrap 5 core code to add "dark mode" functionality and is declared as a "Proof of Concept" *(PoC)* - that means it's not intended as a production source, but merely an exercise to prove that dark-mode is attainable via various methods, i.e. it is an educative piece.  It also means that it's author *(Vino Rodrigues)* is not compelled to support it.

#### Note 2:

This project will ***not*** compile with Node-Sass.  Refer to the original Bootstrap 5 docs, especially here (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/build-tools/#sass), and you'll note that they have deprecated the use of Node-Sass in favour of Dart-Sass.

They in turn cite this (https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) article wherein the Sass curators state they will no longer support LibSass, that Node-Sass is dependant on.
